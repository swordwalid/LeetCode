## Description

This repository contains my Python solutions to LeetCode problems. I'm aiming to improve my problem-solving skills in Python and contribute to the open-source community.

## Structure
The repository is organized by LeetCode problem number (e.g., 001_Two_Sum, 021_Merge_Two_Sorted_Lists). Each problem folder contains:

problem.md (or similar): A file describing the LeetCode problem statement, test cases, and any specific considerations for the solution.
solution.py: Python code for solving the LeetCode problem.
